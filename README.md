[COVID-19 CASES IN MALAYSIA (17 MAY 2021) | Tableau Public](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/muhammad.farhad/viz/COVID-19CASESINMALAYSIA17MAY2021/ConfirmedCasesDashboard)

## Motivation

This visualization was created as part of a Story and Data Visualization Course in Universiti Malaysia Pahang.

## Methodology

With the assistance of the researchers from MalaysiaKini Lab, I gained access to raw COVID-19 data for Malaysia. During that period, the government lacked a systematic approach to displaying COVID-19 data. MalaysiaKini Lab employed a crowdsourced method to gather and subsequently publish the data on their website. Through communication with one of their representatives, I obtained the necessary data. This data underwent a thorough cleaning and massaging process before being fed into Tableau for visualization. Additionally, a short-term prediction feature was implemented, which yielded an 80% accuracy in matching real case numbers with the predictions.
